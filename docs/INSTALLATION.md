## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't appear on Overleaf

- Make sure you're on `www.overleaf.com` (not a custom domain)
- Refresh the Overleaf page after installing
- Check that the extension is enabled in your browser's extension settings

### "API token not configured" error

- Open extension settings and enter your token
- Make sure you copied the full token (40 characters)
- Try generating a new token at [ADS Token Settings](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/token)

### Libraries not loading

- Check your internet connection
- Verify your token is valid at [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/)
- Try clicking the refresh button (↻) in the panel
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)

### Citation not inserting

- Make sure your cursor is in the editor (click in the document first)
- Try using the keyboard shortcut instead
- If using Firefox, the clipboard fallback should work

### "Rate limit exceeded" error

- Wait a few seconds and try again
- ADS limits requests; the extension handles this automatically

## Security Notes

- Your API token is stored **locally** in your browser using the extension storage API
- The token is **never** sent anywhere except to `api.adsabs.harvard.edu`
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry is collected
- You can revoke your token anytime at [ADS settings](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/token)

## Uninstalling

1. Go to your browser's extensions page
2. Find "ADS for Overleaf"

## Building from Source

For developers who want to modify the extension:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yipihey/inspire-for-overleaf.git
cd inspire-for-overleaf

# (Optional) Set up shared library for development
cd lib
ln -s ../../shared-ads-lib/dist/esm shared-ads-lib
cd ..

# Load directly in browser - no build step required!
```

The extension uses vanilla JavaScript and doesn't require a build step.
